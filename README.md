- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**  
  Provides powerful tools for creating, managing, and documenting RESTful APIs efficiently.  

- **PostgreSQL**  
  A robust relational database system used for reliable data storage and management.  

- **GraphQL**  
  Enables flexible and efficient querying of data, allowing clients to request only the information they need.  

- **Celery**  
  Handles asynchronous tasks such as background job processing, notifications, and scheduled tasks.  

- **Redis**  
  An in-memory data store used for caching, session management, and as a Celery message broker.  

- **Docker**  
  Provides containerization for consistent

## Database Design

The database is structured around five core entities: Users, Properties, Bookings, Payments, and Reviews. Below is a breakdown of each entity, its key fields, and relationships with other entities.

### Users
- **Fields:** id, name, email, password_hash, created_at  
- **Relationships:**  
  - A user (as an owner) can own multiple properties.  
  - A user (as an customer) can make multiple bookings.  
  - A user (as an customer) can leave multiple reviews.  

### Properties
- **Fields:** id, title, description, location, price, owner_id (FK → Users)  
- **Relationships:**  
  - A property belongs to one user (the owner).  
  - A property can have many bookings.  
  - A property can have many reviews.  

### Bookings
- **Fields:** id, user_id (FK → Users), property_id (FK → Properties), start_date, end_date, status  
- **Relationships:**  
  - A booking belongs to one user.  
  - A booking belongs to one property.  
  - A booking can have one payment.  

### Payments
- **Fields:** id, booking_id (FK → Bookings), amount, payment_date, status  
- **Relationships:**  
  - A payment is linked to one booking.  

### Reviews
- **Fields:** id, user_id (FK → Users), property_id (FK → Properties), rating, comment, created_at  
- **Relationships:**  
  - A review belongs to one user.  
  - A review belongs to one property.

## Feature Breakdown

This project replicates core functionalities of an Airbnb-like platform. Below are the main features and how they contribute to the overall system:

- **User Management**  
  Provides secure user registration, authentication, and profile management. This ensures only authorized users can access the system while giving each user a personalized experience.  

- **Property Management**  
  Allows property owners to create, update, and manage property listings. Users can also retrieve property details to explore available accommodations.  

- **Booking System**  
  Enables users to reserve properties and manage their booking details (such as dates and status). This is central to connecting guests with property owners.  

- **Payment Processing**  
  Integrates a reliable payment system for handling transactions. It records payment details to ensure secure and traceable bookings.  

- **Review System**  
  Lets users leave reviews and ratings for properties. This builds trust and provides feedback for both owners and potential guests.  

- **Data Optimization**  
  Ensures efficient data retrieval and storage through database indexing and query optimization. This keeps the application responsive and scalable as usage grows.  

## API Security

Securing the backend APIs is critical to protect sensitive data, maintain trust, and ensure reliable system operations. The following measures will be implemented:

- **Authentication**  
  Ensures that only verified users can access the system. This protects sensitive data (e.g., user profiles, bookings, and payment details) from unauthorized access.  

- **Authorization**  
  Controls what actions a user is allowed to perform. For example, property owners can manage their own listings, but not others. This prevents malicious or accidental misuse of data.  

- **Data Encryption (HTTPS + Password Hashing)**  
  All communication between the client and server will use HTTPS to prevent eavesdropping. User passwords and sensitive data are stored securely using hashing and encryption techniques to safeguard against breaches.  

- **Rate Limiting & Throttling**  
  Prevents abuse of the APIs by limiting the number of requests from a single client in a given timeframe. This helps defend against brute-force attacks and ensures fair usage.  

- **Input Validation & Sanitization**  
  All user inputs will be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS). This keeps the system safe from malicious data manipulation.  

- **Secure Payments**  
  Payment-related APIs will integrate with trusted gateways and comply with industry standards (e.g., PCI DSS). This ensures that financial transactions remain safe and fraud-resistant.  
## CI/CD Pipeline

A Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying the application. This ensures that changes to the codebase are validated early, reducing bugs, speeding up delivery, and maintaining high-quality standards.

### Why CI/CD is Important
- **Faster Development Cycles** – Automates testing and deployment, allowing developers to release updates quickly and confidently.  
- **Improved Code Quality** – Automatically runs tests and checks on every commit, ensuring issues are caught before reaching production.  
- **Consistency & Reliability** – Provides a repeatable process for deploying changes across different environments (development, staging, production).  

### Tools
- **GitHub Actions** – For automating workflows such as running tests, linting, and deployments.  
- **Docker** – Ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production using containerization.
